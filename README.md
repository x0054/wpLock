# wpLock - Lock for WordPress Login Page

This is a super simple WordPress login page disabler. This will not make your Word Press installation any more secure against a targeted attack. However, it will stop those annoying bots from trying to guess your password constantly. It's a quick hack, feel free to improve and add pull requests.

## Installation

1. Copy wpLock.php to your WordPress install directory
2. Rename to something other then wpLock.php. This is security by obscurity, so use something obscure :)

## Usage
Simply go to the address to the wpLock.php. Unlock and lock the login page from there.

## Word Press Updating
When updating Wordpress, make sure that the login page is unlocked, so that the login.php file can also be updated.
